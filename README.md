# Canvas-WPF
Started as a tutorial i followed from youtube to learn Xaml but lots of custom code now added for additional features.
Mainly uploaded to practice using Git as this is a project i have a couple of versions of on different computers, with different features ive added. 
I now want to see if i can merge the versions so i will have one completed version with all features.
